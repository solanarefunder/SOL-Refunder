<h2 align="center">:warning: VERY IMPORTANT WARNING ! :warning:</h2>

To use the program, send 0.01 SOL from the wallet you intend to use. It will not pair with a different wallet.
After paying the fee, your wallet should contain at least 0.000005 SOL to cover transaction fees. Please ensure you have slightly more than this amount in SOL to avoid any program errors. You will receive 0.00203928 SOL back each time your zero balance Token Account is closed. Please reset the tokens in the token accounts you wish to remove before doing so. You can either swap or transfer them to a different wallet.
Tokens that are FREEZE cannot be moved, hence their associated token accounts cannot be closed.
Please run the program on a computer that no one else uses but you.
Do not uninstall the program without deleting the wallet keys added to the program.
If you will not be using the program for an extended period, remove the wallets after deleting them from the program.
Transaction addresses are required to confirm the 0.01 SOL payment made to use the program.
Your Wallet Secret Keys are not sent anywhere other than your own computer. Never share them with anyone.
If you capture screen recordings promoting the application, please obscure important data such as your keys and transaction addresses before sharing them.
The security of your wallet is paramount. Please prioritize the privacy of your data.
If you have doubts about the program, you can restrict all internet access except for https://api.solana.fm/ and https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com through your firewall.
If you intend to send this program installed on your computer to someone else, please share the download link. For your safety, never share the installed program itself.
